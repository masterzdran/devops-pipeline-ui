---

## 10. General Tasks

- **Testing**
  - Unit and integration tests for all features
- **Security**
  - Follow OWASP best practices for frontend and API interactions
- **Documentation**
  - Update README and user guides

---
## 11. About Page Feature

A dedicated **About** page/component will be included in the application with the following information:

- **List of Contributors:**  
  Displays the GitHub usernames or names of all contributors.
- **Application Version:**  
  Shows the current version of the application.
- **Release Date:**  
  Displays the date of the current release.

This ensures transparency and gives credit to everyone who has contributed to the project.

## Development Guidelines for Features

Each feature listed in this backlog **must be developed as an independent, self-contained module**. The following principles should be followed:

- **Independence:**  
  Each feature should be implemented in isolation, minimizing dependencies on other features. This ensures that features can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.

- **Cohesion:**  
  All code related to a feature (components, hooks, styles, tests) should be grouped together, making the feature easy to understand and modify.

- **Decoupling:**  
  Features should interact with the rest of the application only through well-defined interfaces or shared layers (such as the API layer or common utilities/components). Direct cross-feature dependencies should be avoided.

- **Common Utilities and Components:**  
  Shared logic or UI elements should be placed in a common layer (e.g., `utils/`, `components/`). Features may use these shared resources but should not rely on the internal implementation of other features.

- **Material UI Usage:**  
  It is **not recommended to reinvent the wheel or create components from scratch**. Always use [Material UI](https://mui.com/) components where possible to ensure consistency, accessibility, and maintainability.

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Where possible, each feature should include its own unit tests to ensure correctness and facilitate future refactoring.

By following these guidelines, the codebase will remain modular, scalable, and maintainable as the project grows.
